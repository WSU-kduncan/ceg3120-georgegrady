# Setup
### To use Discord's APIs, we must use authentication tokens and allowing permissions.
### The authentication token must be stored in a .env file, the .env file cannot be commited to the repo for security purposes.
### discord, discord.py, and python-dotenv need to be installed to run the code.
# Usage
### My bot gives short motivational quotes.
### To get a quote, type "!motivateme".
### This will provide a short motivational quote from some well known people.
# Research
### A way to keep the discord bot running all the time would be to host it on a VPS (Virtual Private Server).
### Most of these VPSs are very cheap, it seems like a popular method in the community.
### A very cool solution I found is to host the bot on a raspberry pi and just make sure it stays on.
### Finally, I put all the code on replit, and ran it on my old laptop that has a fried battery (it just has to stay plugged in anyways).
### I checked discord on my phone several hours later while I was at work and thought it was actually cool to be able to use the command from anywhere.
